#### Database Backup Script for MySQL and Dumping to Amazon S3

You can automate the creation of backup and storing it to Amazon S3 within a few minutes. Below bullets brief about what you are going to learn in this part of the article:

* Create a script that automates the MySQL backup directory creation
* Upload/sync the backups with Amazon S3
* Cron will run this command every day (to back up)

### Step 1: Generating a shell script which will dump the MySQL database

```shell
cd ~
mkdir scripts
cd scripts
nano db_backup.sh
```

Copy and paste the script below to it

```shell
#!/bin/bash
DIR=`date +%d-%m-%y`
DEST=~/db_backups/$DIR
mkdir $DEST

mysqldump -h mysql_hostname -u mysql_user  -p"mysql_password" database_name > dbbackup.sql
```

Now chomd the script to allow it to for execution

```shell
chmod +x ~/scripts/db_backup.sh
```

### Step 2: Creating the shell script which sync the backups with Amazon S3

```
nano db_sync.sh
```

Copy and paste the script below to it

```
#!/bin/bash
/usr/local/bin/aws s3 sync ~/db_backups s3://my-bucket-name
```

Now chmod the script to allow it for execution

```
chmod +x ~/scripts/db_sync.sh
```

### Step 3: Creating the folder in Amazon S3 for the database dumps

```
cd ~
mkdir db_backups
```

### Step 4: Time to configure the AWS CLI

Before installing the AWS CLI you need to install`python-pi`. Type the following commands:

```
apt-get update
apt-get -y install python-pip
curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py"
```

[Install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)

Type the following command:

```
pip install awscli
```

### Step 5: Time to set up AWS key & Secret

[Configuration and credential file settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)

```
cd ~
mkdir .aws
nano ~/.aws/config
```

Paste in `key_id `and `secret_access_key` as shown below

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

### Step 6: Set up the Cron (to automate the process)

```
crontab -e
```

Paste the below commands at the bottom to automate the process

```
0 0 * * * ~/scripts/db_backup.sh # take a backup every midnight
0 2 * * * ~/scripts/db_sync.sh # upload the backup at 2am
```

This way the backup script will run and also sync with Amazon S3 daily.

### Conclusion

Hence, by using these scripts you can achieve 3 goals:

1. Creating the database backup via a shell script
2. uploading the dump to Amazon S3
3. also automating this process using Cron.
